INFO30008 Interviews 

Interviews are an important technique for user research and design work. This guide tells you what do for INFO30008 and 
gives you some pointers in planning and carrying out your interviews. Interviews involve collecting data from people, so 
it is important that we follow sound ethical practices of research as are explained below in the section on Ethical 
Procedure. 

Access to your situation-of-use 

Perhaps your biggest challenge is in getting access to people in your situation-of-use to talk to them about what they do. 
Probably the easiest approach is to choose a situation-of-use where one member of your group already has some access. 
This is likely to be when you, or a friend or a family member, have some involvement in the situation-of-use: through 
work, social or leisure activities. Once you have one good contact, that person may act as a ‘gate-keeper’ to help you 
make contact with other stakeholder groups. If access proves too difficult, you will need to change your situation-of-use to 
be one where you can get access. 

Planning an interview 

Conduct your interview as a pair – ie two of you doing the interview. There are a lot of things to get right during an 
interview and it helps to have two people. Meet with your co-interviewer to make a careful plan. Here are the main things 
to prepare. 

• Plan your invitation to the interviewee. Agree who will make the initial contact. Even if the interviewee is a friend or 
family member, take care to compose a polite and considerate email that gives some information about the purpose of 
the interview and invites them to suggest a convenient time and location. Include a Plain Language Statement (PLS) 
as part of your invitation – use the PLS template provided on Canvas. 
• 30 minutes is a good target for an interview, or 15-20 minutes for a very busy person. Often they will agree to 20 
minutes but will actually talk to you for longer. In practice, interviews sometimes go for much longer 1 – 2 hours plus, 
so be prepared for that and take the opportunity. 
• Plan the questions you will put to the interviewee (see next section) and who will ask them. 
• Plan who will do what during the interview. One person should lead by thanking and welcoming the interviewee, 
make introductions and reminding about the purpose of the interview. The other person should be in charge of audio-
recording and note-taking. It is best if you BOTH ask questions at different stages – this gives you time to reflect on 
what the interviewee is saying and helps to steer the interview and avoid repeating yourself. 
• Consider your options for the best and most reliable audio recording equipment. It is best to use two recording devices 
to provide a backup. Use pen and paper during the interview to note down significant things. Your interviewee might 
want to note down or draw something. 
• Pick a good location for the interview. It should be convenient for the interviewee. Hopefully it will be a pleasant 
place for the interviewee to relax and talk freely – but this isn’t always easy. 
• You might need to interview people by zoom or telephone if they are not in Melbourne. This can work well, but still 
follow the procedure outlined here and avoid it becoming a quick chat on the phone. Make sure the interviewee has 
allowed enough time and is in a comfortable unhurried location to take the call. 
• Double-check to make 100% sure that everyone knows the time and place of the interview and is ready. 
• Double-check to be sure that recording equipment will be charged and will work on the day … be sure you have pens 
and note paper with you. 


 


What you need to find out 

Plan your questions for each interviewee carefully. Here are some things to find out that are likely to be relevant for a 
technology design project. 

• How long they have been involved in this situation, and how they first became involved. 
• Their main goals and motivations within the situation. 
• Their main activities. 
• Their relevant skills, knowledge, experience, qualifications. 
• Their emotional experiences: what aspects are enjoyable, rewarding, difficult, challenging, disappointing … 
• Their view of the other stakeholders and their main goals and activities. 
• Technologies or techniques that they current use. 
• Things (skills, techniques, approaches) that they think work well in the situation. 
• Things that they think do not work well or could be improved. 
• Examples of specific incidents that worked well, or did not work well. 


Writing your questions 

Develop some questions to find out information like that listed above. 

It is usually effective to use OPEN-ENDED questions rather than CLOSED QUESTIONS that seek a specific piece of 
information. An OPEN-ENDED question leaves it open to the interviewee how to answer, for example: 

‘Tell us about what you do in this situation?’ 

‘Can you think of a specific case whether this worked well?’ 

Write out your planned questions and then edit them carefully for the following: 

• Keep the expression simple and direct, avoid complex words and double negatives. 
• Keep each question about ONE point – don’t ask about two different things in the same question. 
• Avoid leading questions – these are questions that presume something is true or take a particular viewpoint. 


Conducting the interview 

• Be sure that the audio recording devices are working – beware of being distracted and failing to check this. Take time 
to ensure that what the participant says will be picked up against background noise. Position the recording devices 
carefully. Use a lapel microphone if possible. During the interview, check on recording devices. 
• If you prefer, prior to the interview state the name of the participant and the date and time of the interview. 
Alternatively be prepared to name the audio file meaningfully so that later you will know which recording this was. 


Do the following in the interview: 

• Thank the participant. 
• Introduce yourselves, and set a friendly, relaxed tone. 
• Remind them of the purpose and the length of the interview. 
• IMPORTANT: Provide the interviewee with a Consent form and ask them to confirm that they give permission for 
you to audio-record the interview. Make sure this consent is part of the recording. Confirm that the information will 
be used anonymously. If they ask you NOT to record, then you must instead rely on your hand-written notes. 
• Explain that you will ask some prepared questions. Tell them that these might seem really obvious, but it will be 
valuable to clarify the most basic things. Tell that they are free to tell you anything in reply and do not always need to 
stick to the question. 
• Ask each question clearly. Leave time for the participant to think and respond. Use prompts to keep them going if 
they dry up too soon: ‘Why is that?’ ‘When do you do that?’ ‘Is that important?’ ‘How often would you do that?’ etc 



• If they don’t answer the question and talk about another topic (which often happens) listen carefully as it is often 
about something important that you haven’t thought of … 
• … but gently steer the interview back to get a direct answer your question if possible. 
• Be sure to show that you are listening carefully to their answers: appropriate smiling, laughing, nodding, ‘yes’, ‘that’s 
interesting’ etc 
• It is likely that later questions in the interview will already have been answered by what the participant has already 
said. Watch out for this. You can choose to skip the question, or better say “I realise you’ve covered this, but could I 
just ask again about …”. You will likely get some more valuable information this way. 
• At the end of the interview, CLOSE DOWN clearly by thanking them for their time, and saying how useful it will be 
for your project. Ask them if they have any questions for you. 
• Don’t turn off the recording device until you have parted and the meeting is actually over. Participants often say 
valuable things right at the end when they think it is all over. As long as they know the recording is still active this is 
fine. 


After the interview 

• As soon as possible, make a secure copy and backup of your audio recording files. Store your files on a password-
protected cloud storage – use the University’s OneDrive if you have access to it. Delete all other copies of the data on 
other devices that you might have made during the interview. 
• Send a thank you message to your participant. 
• Be sure to anonymise your participant’s identity (and the identity of any organisation involved) in your records and in 
the transcription of the interview – give them a pseudonym and note down their role/stakeholder group. 
• Transcribe your recording into a text document that includes the date and time of the interview and the 
pseudonymn/role of the participant interviewee. 
• If requested by a participant, send them a copy of your group’s final report for your project at the end of semester. 


Ethical Procedure 

It is important that research involving human participants follows ethical practices. This protects participants and provides 
the researchers protection later if a participant feels aggrieved. The essential points (underlined above) are as follows: 

• Participants must be fully briefed about what to expect in the interview through a Plain Language Statement. Use the 
PLS template on Canvas, and complete the parts shown in red with your project’s details. 
• Participants must given their consent to participate in response to a Consent Form which tells them what they are 
consenting to. This must include consent to a recording being made. Use the Consent Form on Canvas. 
• Store the interview recording on a safe password-protected cloud-based site (use the University’s OneDrive, if 
possible). Destroy these recordings when you have completed this subject. 
• When analysing and reporting your findings, change the names of all participants and any organisations involved to 
pseudonyms. 
• Provide a copy of your group’s final report to any participant who requests it.
