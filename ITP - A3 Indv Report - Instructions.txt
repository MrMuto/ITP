A3. INDIVIDUAL REPORT 
INFO30008 Interactive Technology Project 
DIGITAL INNOVATION PROPOSAL 
  
Due: 5:00pm Wednesday of Week 15 (8th November 2023) 
Worth:  40% of subject total mark 
Length:   3000 words  + figures (word count does not include references) 
  
Overview 
In this final report, you are asked to write a report on your group’s project. So far, your group has submitted a file of evidence about activities concerned with analysis, ideation, prototyping, and evaluation with users. Your task now is to provide an interpretation of this evidence in the form of a reasoned and persuasive account about the potential value of your design.  You can draw on evidence from both the preliminary and main design cycles of your group project. 
  
How to submit 
• Every student to submit their own individual report through LMS. 

• Include a coversheet with your name and student number– add your name to page 1 of your report. 


  
What to cover  
Your aim in this report is to answer the following three questions: 
 
• What is the status of your group’s design concept? What have you learned overall through the evaluation about your original design concept? Consider questions such as: How well your prototype performed? Was it easy to understand and use? Did people understand what it was for? And so on. The focus here is on direct users and usability. In answering this question, consider what are the key pieces of evidence that lead you to this view. Show this evidence in detail by selecting and presenting key examples of screenshots, excerpts or summaries from interview transcripts, evaluation observations, and/or other relevant technologies.  

• What are the potential outcomes and consequences of your design? If your main design concept was taken up by its intended users, describe how it would benefit or otherwise affect stakeholders in the situation of use, and possibly beyond. Explain carefully how these benefits would be realised in practice, citing your project’s evidence where applicable. Identify any risks that your design would bring to the situation, and explain if you believe the benefits would outweigh these risks, or vice versa. The focus here goes beyond direct users and consider all of the stakeholders in your Rich Picture. 

• Present a possible next step for your design. Describe and illustrate a plan for a next design cycle for your group’s design concept. This should drill down deeper into the current design and explore an area of functionality in greater detail. Use simple screen mock-ups to illustrate the form and features of this next design cycle. Explain and justify why you believe this next step is a productive direction to take, both in terms of the broader situation of use, and in terms of the usability of the new functionality you explore. 


 
  
Writing style and structure 
You are free to structure the report in the way you see fit. Consider how best to present it in a clear and persuasive manner.  
• Include an Executive Summary of 200 words max. 

• Structure the report into sections that help to make sense of the material and your arguments. 

• Use informative and engaging heading and sub-headings throughout that convey the important points to be made. 

• Use language and terms carefully to convey the depth of your thinking about design and your understanding of how this fits into design thinking more widely; avoid casual, vague or otherwise confusing language, and especially avoid unconvincing or unsupportable claims. 

• Use formatting carefully (and sparingly) to emphasise important points or elements of material. 

• Include captions and title for all figures, tables or images presented, with explanations and references to them in the text 

• Use sources to link your work to published evidence that is relevant to  your analysis, or established ideas in design thinking or about your particular situation-of-use and/or other relevant technologies. 

• Include references to any source you use and take care not to incorporate material verbatim from them (see over). 


  
Work on this assignment across the whole of semester 
This assignment presents you with the challenge to make sense of the various pieces of evidence that your team has collected and transform it into a readable and persuasive account that shows the depth of your design thinking. This is a difficult challenge that will take time to get right. 
IMPORTANT TIP 1:  Keep your own individual journal of thoughts and notes about the project from day one of semester onwards. In this, note down your key thoughts about what is most important or significant about your situation-of-use, your design, and your evaluation evidence.  
  
Readings about Design Thinking 
Your final account of the project will only be persuasive if it demonstrates familiarity and understanding of design thinking. Again, these ideas take time to understand and for you to work out which of the ideas can be applied to your project work.  
IMPORTANT TIP 2:  Read the designated readings from the key text by Kees Dorst. This is not easy to do, and many of the ideas will seem mysterious. We will talk about the ideas in class, but reading them for yourself will expand your understanding and increase the maturity of your writing about them. 
  
Assessment criteria 
The criteria being applied to all assignments in this subject are: 
• Appropriate and creative execution of techniques  

• Clarity and coherence of evidence, explanation and arguments  

• Quality of the account and expression of design thinking and design process 


  
How to reference sources 
To refer to articles that you wish to cite when writing your report, use the Harvard style; as used in the journal article and academic book chapters. Look at the readings listed in this subject as examples. 
 
As you write your report, refer to the articles as you need to by citing the author family name and date.  
For example:  
'Juran (1964) has found that ...'   or   'Swiss (1992), however, argued that ...'.  
If there are two authors, give both names: 'Smith & Chang (2004) believed that ...'.  
If there are more than two authors, you can shorten it to: 'Vaucanson et al (2002) reported a study of ....'. 
 
At the end of your article provide a Reference Section that lists ALL of the articles that you cite in your report. Put these in author-name alphabetical order. Take care to format each reference in the way that it is done in academic articles. 
 
A guide for how to reference sources in your reports is provided at  http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/cite/ 
  
Academic Integrity 
Take care to ensure that you follow the principles of academic integrity. 
 
Your submitted work must be entirely your own. Be sure that you do not submit work done by another student OR material taken from a source. If unsure ask Wally and see the link below …

Late Penalties 
Assignments which are submitted after the due date and time, will receive a penalty of 10% of the total marks available per working day late, up to a maximum of five days. Assignments submitted after five days will not be marked and a grade of zero will be recorded.
