Notes for A3 Report
W12
A3 Report:
• Whole project - second part was more important so they expect this to come through
• 3 Questions:
• 1000 words on each question.
• Informative and engaging headings
– Writing a report like this has parallels with UX design - think about the user (the marking instructor).
– Things to avoid:
– Not mentioning UI/UX language at all - using common language - principles ways of talking about - analytical and use the principles - use this terminology carefully / sparingly
– Using way too much terminology
– Draw from materials:
– There are pages cited in the W12 slides
– (Chapter 3 of Dorst, Norman, etc.) - use sensible reference (2-5 references expected):
• Careful referencing - shows respect for someone’s else's work
• Problem situation / arena = situation-of-use in ITP (cite Dorst) p52
• Understand the different and conflicting perspectives of stakeholders and talk about the paradoxes that emerge from this.
• Centrally important in the book is the frame. There are other ways of understanding the situation. Or reframing it in his language.
  Q1:
– What data was important?
– What have you found, is there promise,
– What do you now believe about the concept
– You will be presenting the data from the A2 report, but in your own words.
– Reproduce some other figures, images, and data. Label them “these are coming from A2 Report” and add your commentary on it(doesn’t add to work count)
  Q2:
– Goes back to RP, definition of problem situation
– If this was a working product, what would the impact on the situation of use:
• Speak to all of the stakeholders involved - examine the pattern of effects and relationships
• It may create opportunities / benefits, but it might create new risks.
  Q3:
– The design process - we’ve finished 2 cycles
– If there was a 3rd, what would be in the next iteration of the prototype.
• Which elements would you explore?
• What idea would you want to test?
• Expand scope, add a new feature / function
• Could go back to Figma (1-2 screenshots to illustrate the next idea) - simplify prototypes?
– Could be a wireframe
• Do not need a introduction and conclusion in the report.
• Just go straight into answering the section.
Non-linear and iterative quality / property of design has been promoted and grows out of our field
A journey, exploring:
1. Empathise
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test
From W10 Notes - A3 Individual Report
• The status of the proposal report was done periodically, or the current state?
• Do you want a status on the project throughout?
• Summarising the main points of the evaluation
• How could this impact / improve peoples lives? Less evidence based and is more speculative.
– Risks and opportunities
• 1st bullet point = evidence based
• 2nd bullet point = first-person / personal experience. It’s okay to use ‘I’, but find another way. Sometimes you’ll be sharing an objective viewpoint mixed in with.
A Paradox in the Complex System
With regard to non-sensitive, publicly available information - an interactive node-graph of this sort requires immense amounts of data in provision of trustworthy information. This in essence, is an aggregator of information presented in a visual and interactive format. Though, if we desire to move beyond aggregating information to address human connections, privacy and consent is a significant, but necessary factor to address.
If the app relies on large quantities of data to influence the map, maybe it is not realistic to have all of this data represented at higher levels. We could establish a threshold between the the lower level descriptions. From a business sense, a mechanism for revenue could be implemented here - a tiering of privileges / access. Then comes the issue of the incentive behind experts to share their knowledge and experiences.
If the app relies upon user information to illustrate their stories to build connections and trust between people , this grapples with privacy, and a contradiction exists here as the goal of being a reliable aggregator of information while promoting genuine human connections are at odds, and a significant hurdle to overcome. Unless we rely on a ad-revenue model, which is a less than ideal solution.
1. Anonymity could work when displaying displaying clusters of high-level data.
2. As you get to lower-levels, trust and credibility are of greater importance:
– Maybe a cut-off / threshold at some point between the low and high-level data.

Final presentation videos
1. Main prototype scope and detail?
2. Main design concept?
3. Motivations (from the situation of use)?
4. Evaluation method?
5. Main findings: hits & misses?
6. Conclusion?
Video Examples:
FoodPal
• They did not show any participant videos
• What they were showing was a focused on the design.
Is it clear what motivates the problem / design idea and how they evaluated it?
1. Motivations:
– Domestic food waste.
– Backed it up with evidence.
– Mentioned the various stakeholders.
– Why did they decide on which stakeholder?
– Who did you interview?
– Mentioned literature.
• Cited user perspective (unsure if this was sourced from interviews)
• Then moved to proposed ‘Solution’
– Cited how users stored their food.
– Mentioned features, but highlighted on a specific and most relevant one.
– Cited usability principles.
• Then moved to testing methods, their demographic, brief explanation of the tasks.
• Spoke to the results - citing principles.
– Issues .
– Likes / dislikes.
Finished / concluded with their mission.
• Don’t end with a thank you - end on a slide of an image / design of what you are actually offering the world - conclude what you have been talking about in the presentation.

For TrailMix
• Say something more about usefulness. If somebody does use it, how is it going to address the initial problem that has been identified?
• Make it clear what motivates the problem / design idea and how we evaluated it.

Ideation
Questions to ask
• Evaluation of novice or professionals.
How Might We
• How might we engage citizens in policy decisions that effect them?
• How might we enhance the experience of the outdoors?
Worst Customer Experience:
• Gas stations, airports and grocery stores are the worst retail experiences. Scott Galloway (2023)
• Disruptable industries. Disruption depends on how rife an industry is to be disrupted vs. the disruptive technology itself. Timing is key.
• What industry is most ripe for disruption?
Disruptable Industry and Breakthrough Technologies
Think about: How to make a 4D problem Represented in a easier an easier way to understand on a 2D Dimensional Display.
All providers - Bus, Train and Tram.
When is it going to be there
Providing way more information on where its going to be, what its connected to.
Look at train maps.
You have to think about how these apps are regulated in each country, an example would be Facebook trying to develop something like WeChat, but cannot do so in the US. The app marketplace operates differently depending on the jurisdiction.
Foldable?
Application Layer:
• Bypass this?
• How?
• Is it necessary?
Incentive and Trust Problem
What incentive is there for professionals to help others?
Review each of your initial design ideas in turn. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each in terms of the following:
• Can you imagine how it might be developed further in a lightweight prototype?
• Does it provoke next-level design questions (ie Which direction to take it? Which way to implement it? Lower level functions to be designed?)
• Does it offer to make an impact on the lives of people in your Rich Picture? – How might you evaluate the success of this design idea in the next cycle?
• Decide which design idea(s) you want to develop in the main design cycle
– You can choose to combine one or two or more of your initial ideas together. Most groups will do this. However, don't fall into the trap of developing a comprehensive app that promises to do everything. This will confuse your design thinking and make your final evaluation hard to conduct in a meaningful way. Strive to maintain a singular overall design concept.
• The greater focus you achieve around a singular design idea;
• The deeper your design work will develop;
• The clearer your evaluation will be;
• Producing a more compelling and successful design project.

(1) try to understand, shape and encourage the dreams of their protégés;
(2) often give their blessing on the dreams and goals of their protégés;
(3) provide opportunities for their protégés to observe and participate in their work by inviting their protégés to work with them; and
(4) teach their protégés the politesse of getting ahead in the organization. The role, function and importance of a mentor can be summarized into three major

Evaluation
Social media, not social distancing is what contributed to teen depression. COVID was not to blame.
People are willing to spend money on experiences. “Revenge travel”
Work from is a sticky, enduring change. Remote work. People are spending a significant proportion of income on travel. Live entertainment is surging.
People have a renewed sense of the value value of time vs. money. (finite)

**My view on the distinction between Usability Design Rational and User Based Evaluation. **************The ideas from the text present mentoring as a factor determining professional success, but this is a complex relationship. It states, "[ . . . ] how mentoring is defined determines the extent of the mentoring found."
An attempt to foster organic relationships via the platform offers a paradox, so your take on widespread general guidance is convincing as it addresses this—and brings me to your relevant technology of these online forums.
If you remember, we discussed something along the lines of aggregating common questions asked and then an upvote for answers, and I think we should revisit this.
My reasons for harping on about this is that: (a) Interactive data visualisations/infographics exist. Let's assume they're tried and tested, people like them. (b) Aggregating career steps and pathways has utility but lacks innovation, in my opinion. (c) Usability Design Rationale is distinct from a User Based Evaluation; the former is of the principles we're well versed in, and the latter evaluates the value of our proposal.
We can move ahead with User-Based Evaluation, though I do not think what we are evaluating addresses the value of our proposal. I feel we possess the ability to delve deeper into this problem but also understand if you do not have the resources. Please let me know what you all think.

Note:
• Implement feedback into report, and talk about this.
Collaborative Decisions
How will we pick a style for the app?
Choose a style via vote in Miro
• Post submissions (can be more than 1) in Miro by Tuesday night
• Vote/decide on Miro board Wednesday


Questions when developing your prototype:
SCOPE ?
• deciding the breadth of coverage
DEPTH ?
• deciding the level of detail
Decide scope and depth in relation to TWO aims of your prototype:
• To demonstrate your MAIN DESIGN CONCEPT
• To provide SUFFICIENTLY REALISTIC functions and content for the USER-BASED EVALUATION


What exactly are we choosing to evaluate?
• Mentorship matching (speed dating format):
– Incentive
– Trust
• Data sharing:
– Incentive
– Trust
• Ability to explore options
A2 Report = Catalogue of design process:
Which tasks can be done collaboratively and which can be done individually?
• Key decisions
• Deliverables
A3 Report = Narrative 1 and a half week after A2 submission
Infographic
Does it change depending on:
• Discovery
• Focus
• Apply
• Sorted
From Lecture 8 - Usability Design Rationale
From now on you control the plan and the tasks to focus on week by week:
• From today, there are 4 weeks to the Final A2 Presentation in Week 11Then +2 more weeks to produce on your Final A2 Report
• Then 1.5 more weeks to write your A3 Individual Report
Important things to plan from today are:
• The main prototype;
• The user-based evaluation
Factor in enough time for all the tasks. Consider which are the big tasks, which tasks require coordination within the group, which tasks can be done as individuals and then brought back to the group.

Notes: Next Design Cycle
QUESTION:   For the Week 5 presentation and report, should we present one overall idea for the group, or all of our separate design ideas.  Likewise, the same questions apply for what is to be included in the assignment 1 group report.
ANSWER:  The aim in the A1 Week 5 Presentation and A1 Report is for you to present your various different design ideas – each one illustrated by one or two screen shots. At this stage, they should be separate ideas, and not to be integrated into a single design or a single XD prototype.  The next stage of the project (Weeks 6 - 11) will be to develop a deeper more developed design concept by reviewing what you have learned from your various design ideas at this stage, and building a more elaborate and integrated prototype.
Items:
If we cannot address culture, ideology or philosophy of an public or private institution. What point in this process could we actually provide a solution toward?
• Discovery
• Mentorship
• Using / improve upon AI?
• What does it mean to explore and discover a career path?
– LOOK AT WHAT JACK SENT YOU.
Revisit the brief with the project plan.
• Have a think about the apps, where they overlap and where we want to focus our efforts. Are there any that can be combined? Do we throw any of them out? —Sarah and Quiana's see to have some similarities.
• Let's be careful in not trying to do too much.
• Cross reference the ideas generated.
• You can’t direct people where to go, it takes exploration. So how could we promote this?

Design as Reasoning Chapter 3 p45
To sum up: this comparison establishes the design professions as thinking fundamentally differently from fields that are predominantly based on analysis (deduction, induction) and problem-solving (normal abduction).
Deduction and Induction predict and explain real-world phenomena.
• Deduction—solid reasoning from cause to effect.
• Induction—discovering patterns.
• Not enough if you want to make something.
Normal abductionDesign abductionResult known:The “what” is missing (an object, a service, a system)Result known:Nature of the outcome. The desired value we want to achieve.Within a fixed pattern of relationshipsChallenge = “what” new elements to createNo known chosen “how”Thus we need to create or choose both a “how” and a “pattern of relationships.”These are quite dependent on one another, and thus should developed in parallel.Requires designersExamine a phase of professional development and explore an idea.
• These are effective ways of steering briefing conversations away from specific outcomes to an exploration of deeper situational values.
• What if the platform could connect those who followed a similar path or are thinking among the same lines.
– They might be willing to help those who are in a certain position establish a way forward.
– Maps their path—upon request.
• ‘Felix requests to view your career journey.’
• Though this could just be a new feature added to LinkedIn or Seek.
• A bonus would be mentorship—similar to certain circles that sponsor individuals.
– Pay what you can afford?
• Find your niche:
– Present this niche.
• The problem is that frames are really only fruitful when they are fully embraced by all team members, and absorbed as an active thought process.
• Questions might be too specific - revisit and open them up.
• Literature about these socio-economic issues
• Difficult career moves and understanding
• Cost of making change goes up as it gets into higher fidelity. Fluidity is the aim. “Swivel on a sixpence”.
Scratch:
• Layers of software compatibility. EV charging UI?
• AR / VR for enhancing the experience of outdoor signage to educate on the landscape (using a realistic render?)

Readings:
Frame Innovation: Create New Thinking by Design by Kees Dorst
The MIT Press, 2015
• Responding to the emergence of problems that are to open, complex, dynamic, and networked that they seem impervious to solution.
• The ability of expert designers create new approaches to problem situations (”framing”). Developing alternative to conventional problem-solving methods.
• Expert design practitioners have developed unique, sophisticated multilayered practices for creating new frames.
• Extend our repertoire of problem-solving practices to deal with the complex, networked world we have created for ourselves.
Things to do before next week's class As a group ...
• Agree on which design idea(s) you will focus on for the Main Design Cycle. Draft a description of your Main Design Concept. See technique sheet for thoughts about what makes for a strong design concept to explore. On your own ...
• Read Dorst Chapter 4. Consider which steps in the Frame Creation Model you have done already. Get a clear idea of what Dorst means by 'Paradox'.
• Identify a Relevant Technology for your group's Main Design Concept - an individual task (500 words)
• Create a Persona (300 words) - an individual task
• Develop a Text Scenarios (300 words) - an individual task
Next steps would be evaluating the other factors considered, but were unable to do so:
1. Privacy & Trust:
a. Data-sharing
b. Trust in establishing human connections
2. Human Co
3. Incentive
From Participant 06:
Development Feasibility
Considering your background as a software developer. What is your perspective on the feasibility of such an application, considering the flows of data involved and how this would be visualised. If you would, could you please provide your perspective on the business case for this platform regarding these issues.
Preliminary interviews uncovered issues with:
• Engagement / re-engagement:
– The human connection side of things could be developed further
• Revenue:
– Add a paywall or subscription function.
• Revenue and maintenance expenses
• You could make something similar, but it depends on the data because it's super data-heavy:
– Access, input and processing.
– Precedent data is important, but the necessary amount of data could be feasible.
Issues with Privacy & Trust
• A lot of people need consenting to their data being used.
• Profiles section - if you have enough people who have done it, then this could be exciting to the user and clicking into it.
– How many people would be willing to give their data away for other people?
‘Hard but not impossible’
