Relevant Technology—Mapping Services
Navigation tools like Google and Apple Maps offer a seamless experience, guiding users through physical environments. Drawing from this, the Main Design Concept aims to guide users through their career journeys.
Origins
Google and Apple Maps simplify geographic information for navigation and information seeking. Similarly, our design concept unravels the complex web of career opportunities, presenting them interactively.
Key Design Concepts
Interactivity:
* Users can delve into career paths, understanding prerequisites with the visualisation of trajectories, akin to zooming or panning on a map.
Personalisation:
* Similar to concepts behind mapping services suggesting routes based on past behaviours, our platform tailors career suggestions to individual inputs and experiences.
* Visual Representation: The platform uses visual cues to represent career pathways inspired by the visually represented data in navigation tools.
Data and UI Experience :
* Backend Data: Navigation tools rely on vast databases and real-time data. Similarly, our platform would need a comprehensive database of career paths, market trends, and user feedback.
* Frontend Data Presentation: Career pathways illustrated in layers, with colour-coding indicating market demand.
UI/UX Elements:
* Intuitive Design: Features like search-by-interest and pinch-to-zoom allow easy navigation through career options.
* Personalised Experience: Platforms offer route suggestions based on past behaviours. Similarly, our platform can incorporate user feedback for a holistic view.
Turn-by-Turn Navigation in Career Pathways:
Career Exploration: 
Users input skills and interests, receiving a step-by-step guide to potential paths.
Upskilling: 
* Users get a sequential guide on required training for chosen paths.
Job Application:
* A structured guide assists users in the job application process.
* Career Progression: Suggestions for career growth are provided based on user roles.
Feedback Mechanism:
* Personalised experiences, interactive visualisations, and dynamic adjustments based on user inputs enhance engagement.
The success of navigation tools offers a blueprint for a user-centric platform. Integrating these elements into "Mapping Pathways" can create an innovative and familiar tool for users.
