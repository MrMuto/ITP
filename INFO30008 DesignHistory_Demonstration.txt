INFO30008 Design History + Demonstration of Prototype 

 

The goal of these two final tasks of the project is to produce a communicable summary of your project. 

 

Design history of your process 

Compile a digital poster (size A2) that summarises and presents your main objectives and findings. Use the 
InDesign template provided on canvas. The template contains some headers that you will leave as they are, and 
some place-holders for your content to be entered. The template is only a guide, feel free to move things around 
to make the space you would like to have for each element – this may differ across projects. But please leave 
the headers and final text as they are. Please add your names as you would like to be known. 

Submit the digital poster on canvas with your A2 Group Report. 

 

Demonstration of prototype in action 

Compile a short 2 minute video that walks through your main prototype. Include spoken and subtitled 
commentary that explains the overall aim of your app, and the aim of each screen as you present it in the video. 
Only show the app in this video, do not include visuals or audio of actual users from your evaluation. You can 
add annotations or other animations to hightlight features of your design, and other video segments of the 
context in which your app might be used. Try to demonstrate as much of your prototype as you can in 2 
minutes, but make sure the elements of your demonstration are clearly shown with sufficient time on them. Err 
on the side of omitting elements, rather than trying to cram everything in. Feel free to re-use video or animation 
material that you presented in the A2 Group Presentation. 

At the beginning of your video, include a 10 second still that shows the title of your app, and the team members. 
For this, use the ‘IT Demonstration’ ppt slide from Canvas. 

Submit the digital poster on canvas with your A2 Group Report.
